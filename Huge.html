</ul><p><strong>Huge</strong> cardinals (and their variants) were introduced by Kenneth Kunen
in 1972 as a very large cardinal axiom. Kenneth Kunen first used them to
prove that the consistency of the existence of a huge cardinal implies
the consistency of $\text{ZFC}$+”there is a $\omega_2$-saturated
$\sigma$-<a href="Filter" title="Filter">ideal</a>
on $\omega_1$”. It is now known that only a
<a href="Woodin" title="Woodin">Woodin</a>
cardinal is needed for this result. However, the consistency of the
existence of an $\omega_2$-complete $\omega_3$-saturated
$\sigma$-ideal on $\omega_2$, as far as the set theory world is
concerned, still requires an almost huge cardinal.

<h2 id="definitions">
<a class="anchor" href="#definitions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definitions</h2>

<p>Their formulation is similar to that of the formulation of
<a href="Superstrong" title="Superstrong">superstrong</a>
cardinals. A huge cardinal is to a
<a href="Supercompact" title="Supercompact">supercompact</a>
cardinal as a superstrong cardinal is to a
<a href="Strong" title="Strong">strong</a>
cardinal, more precisely. The definition is part of a generalized
phenomenon known as the “double helix”, in which for some large cardinal
properties n-$P_0$ and n-$P_1$, n-$P_0$ has less consistency strength
than n-$P_1$, which has less consistency strength than (n+1)-$P_0$,
and so on. This phenomenon is seen only around the <a href="N-fold_variants" title="N-fold variants">n-fold
variants</a>
as of modern set theoretic concerns.
<a class="citation" href="#Kentaro2007">(Kentaro, 2007)</a></p>

<p>Although they are very large, there is a first-order definition which is
equivalent to n-hugeness, so the $\theta$-th n-huge cardinal is
first-order definable whenever $\theta$ is first-order definable. This
definition can be seen as a (very strong) strengthening of the
first-order definition of
<a href="Measurable" title="Measurable">measurability</a>.</p>

<h3 id="elementary-embedding-definitions">
<a class="anchor" href="#elementary-embedding-definitions" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Elementary embedding definitions</h3>

<p>The elementary embedding definitions are somewhat standard. Let
$j:V\rightarrow M$ be a nontrivial <a href="Elementary_embedding" title="Elementary embedding">elementary
embedding</a>
of $V$ into a
<a href="Transitive" title="Transitive">transitive</a>
class $M$ with critical point $\kappa$. Then:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\kappa$ is <strong>almost n-huge with target $\lambda$</strong> iff
$\lambda=j^n(\kappa)$ and $M$ is closed under all of its sequences
of length less than $\lambda$ (that is, $M^{&lt;\lambda}\subseteq
M$).</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is <strong>n-huge with target $\lambda$</strong> iff
$\lambda=j^n(\kappa)$ and $M$ is closed under all of its sequences
of length $\lambda$ ($M^\lambda\subseteq M$).</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is <strong>almost n-huge</strong> iff it is almost n-huge with target
$\lambda$ for some $\lambda$.</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is <strong>n-huge</strong> iff it is n-huge with target $\lambda$ for
some $\lambda$.</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is <strong>super almost n-huge</strong> iff for every $\gamma$, there
is some $\lambda&gt;\gamma$ for which $\kappa$ is almost n-huge
with target $\lambda$ (that is, the target can be made arbitrarily
large).</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is <strong>super n-huge</strong> iff for every $\gamma$, there is some
$\lambda&gt;\gamma$ for which $\kappa$ is n-huge with target
$\lambda$.</li>
  <li>$\kappa$ is <strong>almost huge</strong>, <strong>huge</strong>, <strong>super almost huge</strong>, and
<strong>superhuge</strong> iff it is <strong>almost 1-huge</strong>, <strong>1-huge</strong>, etc.
respectively.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ultrahuge-cardinals">
<a class="anchor" href="#ultrahuge-cardinals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ultrahuge cardinals</h3>

<p>A cardinal $\kappa$ is <strong>$\lambda$-ultrahuge</strong> for
$\lambda&gt;\kappa$ if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding
$j:V\to M$ for some transitive class $M$ such that
$j(\kappa)&gt;\lambda$, $M^{j(\kappa)}\subseteq M$ and
$V_{j(\lambda)}\subseteq M$. A cardinal is <strong>ultrahuge</strong> if it is
$\lambda$-ultrahuge for all $\lambda\geq\kappa$.
<a href="http://logicatorino.altervista.org/slides/150619tsaprounis.pdf" class="external autonumber">[1]</a>
Notice how similar this definition is to the alternative
characterization of
<a href="Extendible" title="Extendible">extendible</a>
cardinals. Furthermore, this definition can be extended in the obvious
way to define $\lambda$-ultra n-hugeness and ultra n-hugeness, as well
as the “<em>almost</em>” variants.</p>

<h3 id="hyperhuge-cardinals">
<a class="anchor" href="#hyperhuge-cardinals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hyperhuge cardinals</h3>

<p>A cardinal $\kappa$ is <strong>$\lambda$-hyperhuge</strong> for
$\lambda&gt;\kappa$ if there exists a nontrivial elementary embedding
$j:V\to M$ for some inner model $M$ such that $\mathrm{crit}(j) =
\kappa$, $j(\kappa)&gt;\lambda$ and $^{j(\lambda)}M\subseteq M$. A
cardinal is <strong>hyperhuge</strong> if it is $\lambda$-hyperhuge for all
$\lambda&gt;\kappa$. <a class="citation" href="#Usuba2017">(Usuba, 2017; Boney, 2017)</a></p>

<h3 id="huge-cardinals">
<a class="anchor" href="#huge-cardinals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Huge* cardinals</h3>

<p>A cardinal $κ$ is <strong>$n$-huge*</strong> if for some $α &gt; κ$, $\kappa$ is
the critical point of an elementary embedding $j : V_α → V_β$ such
that $j^n (κ) &lt;
α$.<a class="citation" href="#Gitmana">(Gitman &amp; Shindler, n.d.)</a></p>

<p>Hugeness* variant is formulated in a way allowing for a virtual variant
consistent with $V=L$: A cardinal $κ$ is <strong>virtually $n$-huge*</strong> if for
some $α &gt; κ$, in a set-forcing extension, $\kappa$ is the critical
point of an elementary embedding $j : V_α → V_β$ such that $j^n(κ)
&lt; α$.<a class="citation" href="#Gitmana">(Gitman &amp; Shindler, n.d.)</a></p>

<h3 id="ultrafilter-definition">
<a class="anchor" href="#ultrafilter-definition" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ultrafilter definition</h3>

<p>The first-order definition of n-huge is somewhat similar to
<a href="Measurable" title="Measurable">measurability</a>.
Specifically, $\kappa$ is measurable iff there is a nonprincipal
$\kappa$-complete
<a href="Filter" title="Filter">ultrafilter</a>,
$U$, over $\kappa$. A cardinal $\kappa$ is n-huge with target
$\lambda$ iff there is a normal $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter, $U$,
over $\mathcal{P}(\lambda)$, and cardinals
$\kappa=\lambda_0&lt;\lambda_1&lt;\lambda_2…&lt;\lambda_{n-1}&lt;\lambda_n=\lambda$
such that:</p>

\[\\forall
i&amp;lt;n(\\{x\\subseteq\\lambda:\\text{order-type}(x\\cap\\lambda\_{i+1})=\\lambda\_i\\}\\in
U)\]

<p>Where $\text{order-type}(X)$ is the
<a href="Order-isomorphism" title="Order-isomorphism">order-type</a>
of the poset $(X,\in)$. <a class="citation" href="#Kanamori2009">(Kanamori, 2009)</a>
$\kappa$ is then super n-huge if for all ordinals $\theta$ there is a
$\lambda&gt;\theta$ such that $\kappa$ is n-huge with target
$\lambda$, i.e. $\lambda_n$ can be made arbitrarily large. If
$j:V\to M$ is such that $M^{j^n(\kappa)}\subseteq M$ (i.e. $j$
witnesses n-hugeness) then there is a ultrafilter $U$ as above such
that, for all $k\leq n$, $\lambda_k = j^k(\kappa)$, i.e. it is not
only $\lambda=\lambda_n$ that is an iterate of $\kappa$ by $j$; all
members of the $\lambda_k$ sequence are.</p>

<p>As an example, $\kappa$ is 1-huge with target $\lambda$ iff there is a
normal $\kappa$-complete ultrafilter, $U$, over
$\mathcal{P}(\lambda)$ such that
$\{x\subseteq\lambda:\text{order-type}(x)=\kappa\}\in U$. The
reason why this would be so surprising is that every set
$x\subseteq\lambda$ with every set of order-type $\kappa$ would be in
the ultrafilter; that is, every set containing
$\{x\subseteq\lambda:\text{order-type}(x)=\kappa\}$ as a subset is
considered a “large set.”</p>

<p>As for hyperhugeness, the following are
equivalent:<a class="citation" href="#Boney2017">(Boney, 2017)</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>$κ$ is $λ$-hyperhuge;</li>
  <li>$μ &gt; λ$ and a normal, fine, κ-complete ultrafilter exists on
$[μ]^λ_{∗κ} := \{s ⊂ μ : |s| = λ, |s ∩ κ| ∈ κ,
\mathrm{otp}(s ∩ λ) &lt; κ\}$;</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{L}_{κ,κ}$ is $[μ]^λ_{∗κ}$-$κ$-compact for type
omission.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cn-m-huge-cardinals">
<a class="anchor" href="#cn-m-huge-cardinals" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>$C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge cardinals</h3>

<p>(this section from <a class="citation" href="#Bagaria2012">(Bagaria, 2012)</a>)</p>

<p>$κ$ is
<strong><a href="Correct" class="mw-redirect" title="Correct">$C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge</a></strong>
iff it is $m$-huge and $j(κ) ∈ C^{(n)}$ ($C^{(n)}$-huge if it is huge
and $j(κ) ∈ C^{(n)}$).</p>

<p>Equivalent definition in terms of normal measures: κ is
$C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge iff it is uncountable and there is a $κ$-complete
normal
<a href="Ultrafilter" class="mw-redirect" title="Ultrafilter">ultrafilter</a>
$U$ over some $P(λ)$ and cardinals $κ = λ_0 &lt; λ_1 &lt; . . . &lt;
λ_m = λ$, with $λ_1 ∈ C (n)$ and such that for each $i &lt; m$, $\{x
∈ P(λ) : ot(x ∩ λ i+1 ) = λ i \} ∈ U$.</p>

<p>It follows that “$κ$ is $C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge” is $Σ_{n+1}$ expressible.</p>

<p>Every huge cardinal is $C^{(1)}$-huge.</p>

<p>The first $C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge cardinal is not $C^{(n+1)}$-$m$-huge, for
all $m$ and $n$ greater or equal than $1$. For suppose $κ$ is the least
$C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge cardinal and $j : V → M$ witnesses that $κ$ is
$C^{(n+1)}$-$m$-huge. Then since “x is $C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge” is $Σ_{n+1}$
expressible, we have $V_{j(κ)} \models$ “$κ$ is $C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge”.
Hence, since $(V_{j(κ)})^M = V_{j(κ)}$, $M \models$ “$∃_{δ &lt;
j(κ)}(V_{j(κ)} \models$ “δ is huge”$)$”. By elementarity, there is a
$C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge cardinal less than $κ$ in $V$ – contradiction.</p>

<p>Assuming <a href="Rank_into_rank" title="Rank into rank">$\mathrm{I3}(κ,
δ)$</a>,
if $δ$ is a limit cardinal (instead of a successor of a limit cardinal –
Kunen’s Theorem excludes other cases), it is equal to $sup\{j^m(κ) : m
∈ ω\}$ where $j$ is the elementary embedding. Then $κ$ and $j^m(κ)$ are
$C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge (inter alia) in $V_δ$, for all $n$ and $m$.</p>

<p>If $κ$ is $C^{(n)}$-$\mathrm{I3}$, then it is $C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge, for
all $m$, and there is a normal ultrafilter $\mathcal{U}$ over $κ$ such
that</p>

<p>$\{α &lt; κ : α$ is $C^{(n)}$-$m$-huge for every $m\} ∈ \mathcal{U}$.</p>

<h2 id="consistency-strength-and-size">
<a class="anchor" href="#consistency-strength-and-size" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Consistency strength and size</h2>

<p>Hugeness exhibits a phenomenon associated with similarly defined large
cardinals (the <a href="N-fold_variants" title="N-fold variants">n-fold
variants</a>)
known as the <em>double helix</em>. This phenomenon is when for one n-fold
variant, letting a cardinal be called n-$P_0$ iff it has the property,
and another variant, n-$P_1$, n-$P_0$ is weaker than n-$P_1$, which
is weaker than (n+1)-$P_0$. <a class="citation" href="#Kentaro2007">(Kentaro, 2007)</a> In
the consistency strength hierarchy, here is where these lay (top being
weakest):</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<a href="Measurable" title="Measurable">measurable</a> = 
0-<a href="Superstrong" title="Superstrong">superstrong</a> = 
0-huge</li>
  <li>n-superstrong</li>
  <li>n-fold supercompact</li>
  <li>(n+1)-fold strong, n-fold extendible</li>
  <li>(n+1)-fold Woodin, n-fold Vopěnka</li>
  <li>(n+1)-fold Shelah</li>
  <li>almost n-huge</li>
  <li>super almost n-huge</li>
  <li>n-huge</li>
  <li>super n-huge</li>
  <li>ultra n-huge</li>
  <li>(n+1)-superstrong</li>
</ul>

<p>All huge variants lay at the top of the double helix restricted to some
<a href="Omega" title="Omega">natural
number</a> n,
although each are bested by
<a href="Rank-into-rank" class="mw-redirect" title="Rank-into-rank">I3</a>
cardinals (the <a href="Elementary_embedding" title="Elementary embedding">critical
points</a>
of the I3 elementary embeddings). In fact, every I3 is preceeded by a
stationary set of n-huge cardinals, for all n.
<a class="citation" href="#Kanamori2009">(Kanamori, 2009)</a></p>

<p>Similarly, every huge cardinal $\kappa$ is almost huge, and there is a
normal measure over $\kappa$ which contains every almost huge cardinal
$\lambda&lt;\kappa$. Every superhuge cardinal $\kappa$ is
<a href="Extendible" title="Extendible">extendible</a>
and there is a normal measure over $\kappa$ which contains every
extendible cardinal $\lambda&lt;\kappa$. Every (n+1)-huge cardinal
$\kappa$ has a normal measure which contains every cardinal $\lambda$
such that $V_\kappa\models$”$\lambda$ is super n-huge”
<a class="citation" href="#Kanamori2009">(Kanamori, 2009)</a>, in fact it contains every
cardinal $\lambda$ such that $V_\kappa\models$”$\lambda$ is ultra
n-huge”.</p>

<p>Every n-huge cardinal is m-huge for every m&lt;n. Similarly with almost
n-hugeness, super n-hugeness, and super almost n-hugeness. Every almost
huge cardinal is
<a href="Vopenka" title="Vopenka">Vopěnka</a>
(therefore the consistency of the existence of an almost-huge cardinal
implies the consistency of Vopěnka’s principle).
<a class="citation" href="#Kanamori2009">(Kanamori, 2009)</a> Every ultra n-huge is super
n-huge and a stationary limit of super n-huge cardinals. Every super
almost (n+1)-huge is ultra n-huge and a stationary limit of ultra n-huge
cardinals.</p>

<p>In terms of size, however, the least n-huge cardinal is smaller than the
least
<a href="Supercompact" title="Supercompact">supercompact</a>
cardinal (assuming both exist).
<a class="citation" href="#Kanamori2009">(Kanamori, 2009)</a> This is because n-huge
cardinals have upward reflection properties, while supercompacts have
downward reflection properties. Thus for any $\kappa$ which is
supercompact and has an n-huge cardinal above it, $\kappa$ “reflects
downward” that n-huge cardinal: there are $\kappa$-many n-huge
cardinals below $\kappa$. On the other hand, the least super n-huge
cardinals have <em>both</em> upward and downward reflection properties, and are
all <em>much</em> larger than the least supercompact cardinal. It is notable
that, while almost 2-huge cardinals have higher consistency strength
than superhuge cardinals, the least almost 2-huge is much smaller than
the least super almost huge.</p>

<p>While not every $n$-huge cardinal is
<a href="Strong" title="Strong">strong</a>,
if $\kappa$ is almost $n$-huge with targets
$\lambda_1,\lambda_2…\lambda_n$, then $\kappa$ is
$\lambda_n$-strong as witnessed by the generated $j:V\prec M$. This
is because $j^n(\kappa)=\lambda_n$ is
<a href="Measurable" title="Measurable">measurable</a>
and therefore $\beth_{\lambda_n}=\lambda_n$ and so
$V_{\lambda_n}=H_{\lambda_n}$ and because
$M^{&lt;\lambda_n}\subset M$, $H_\theta\subset M$ for each
$\theta&lt;\lambda_n$ and so
$\cup\{H_\theta:\theta&lt;\lambda_n\} =
\cup\{V_\theta:\theta&lt;\lambda_n\} = V_{\lambda_n}\subset
M$.</p>

<p>Every almost $n$-huge cardinal with targets
$\lambda_1,\lambda_2…\lambda_n$ is also
<a href="Supercompact" title="Supercompact">$\theta$-supercompact</a>
for each $\theta&lt;\lambda_n$, and every $n$-huge cardinal with
targets $\lambda_1,\lambda_2…\lambda_n$ is also
$\lambda_n$-supercompact.</p>

<p>For $2$-huge $κ$, $V_κ$ is a model of $\mathrm{ZFC}$+“there are proper
class many hyper-huge
cardinals”.<a class="citation" href="#Usuba2017">(Usuba, 2017)</a> Hyper-huge

the model $M$ can be required to have $M^\lambda\subset M$.</p>

<p>Sadly, $\omega$-huge cardinals are inconsistent with ZFC by a version
of Kunen’s inconsistency theorem. Now, $\omega$-hugeness is used to
describe critical points of
<a href="Rank-into-rank" class="mw-redirect" title="Rank-into-rank">I1 embeddings</a>.</p>

it is shown that if $\text{ZFC +}$ “there is a huge cardinal” is
consistent then so is $\text{ZF +}$ “$\omega_1$ is a huge cardinal”
(with the ultrafilter characterization of hugeness).</p>

<p>If there is an almost huge cardinal then there is a model of
$\text{ZF+}\neg\text{AC}$ in which every successor cardinal is a
<a href="Ramsey" title="Ramsey">Ramsey</a>
cardinal. It follows that (1) for all inner models $W$ of $\text{ZFC}$
and every singular cardinal $\kappa$, one has $\kappa^{+W} &lt;
\kappa^+$ and that (2) for all ordinal $\alpha$ there is no injection
$\aleph_{\alpha+1}\to 2^{\aleph_\alpha}$. This in turn imply the
failure of the
