        <h1>Infinity</h1>
        <ul class="section-nav">
</ul><p>The Greeks had already noted that there are two ways of considering
infinity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Potential infinity is what we consider when we say that counting
never ends. Whatever natural number you can think of, there is a
bigger number. Formally</li>
</ul>

<p>\((\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{N})(\\exists y) (y&amp;gt;x),\) and this is not
really deniable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Actual infinity is what happens when we switch the order: There is a
number which is bigger than any natural number you can think of.
Formally</li>
</ul>

<p>\((\\exists y)(\\forall x\\in\\mathbb{N})(y&amp;gt;x),\) and this naturally
implies that $y$ cannot be a member of $\mathbb{N}$.</p>

<p>The existence of an actual infinity is philosophically non trivial and
not accepted by all mathematicians. Its existence cannot be proven; it
is axiomatically given (see
<a href="ZFC" title="ZFC">ZFC</a>).</p>

<p>The real question however is, given a collection, how does one determine
whether it is finite or not. Certainly, if one can count all the
elements of a collection, then the collection is finite, but who can
count up to a
<a href="Googol" title="Googol">googol</a>?
yet it is finite.</p>

<p>Gallileo noticed that there are as many even numbers as there are
positive integers. To see this without formal machinery: imagine the
collection of all positive integers. Don’t try to imagine them
individually, imagine them as a completed collection. Now multiply them
all by 2. There are no left overs. This violates the Greek saying that
the whole is greater than the parts.</p>

<p>This leads to Dedekind’s characterisation: A finite set cannot be in
one-to-one relation with a proper subset. An infinite set is a set that
can be in one-to-one relation with a proper subset.</p>

<p>In this sense, once accepted the existence of the set of all natural
numbers, $\mathbb{N}$ is infinite since it is possible to map $n$ to
$n+1$ thus providing a one-to-one relation from $\mathbb{N}$ to
$\mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\}$.</p>
