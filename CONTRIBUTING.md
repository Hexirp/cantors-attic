# How to contribute

Pages are in markdown, prepared from the original sources from web.archive.org,
with some manual intervention.

The sources from web.archive.org are also in the repository, and the
scripts to retrieve the sources and convert them to markdown are in the
`bin/` directory.

You can help in several ways:

- by contributing new content
- by improving the automated conversion from the original to markdown
- by improving jekyll configuration
- by improving the layout (javascript etc)

If you improve the automated conversion, manual changes that were not automated
should be kept, and the README.md should be copied over from the `Cantor's_Attic.md`
generated file.
