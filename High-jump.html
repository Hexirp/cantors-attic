</ul><p><em>High-jump</em> cardinals are a certain kind of large cardinals. A cardinal
$\kappa$ is <em>high-jump</em> if it is the critical point of an <a href="Elementary_embedding" title="Elementary embedding">elementary
embedding</a>
$j:V\to M$ such that $M$ is closed under sequences of length
$\text{sup}\{j(f)(\kappa)|f:\kappa\to\kappa\}$. This closure
condition is a weakening of the definition of a
<a href="Huge" title="Huge">huge</a>
cardinal.</p>

<h2 id="definition">
<a class="anchor" href="#definition" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definition</h2>

<p>Let $j:M\to N$ be a (nontrivial) elementary embedding. The <em>clearance</em>
of $j$ is the ordinal $\text{sup}\{j(f)(\kappa)$ $|$
$f:\kappa\to\kappa,f\in M\}$ where $\kappa$ is the critical point
of $j$.</p>

<p>A cardinal $\kappa$ is <strong>high-jump</strong> if there exists $j:V\to M$ with
critical point $\kappa$ and clearance $\theta$ such that
$M^\theta\subseteq M$, i.e. $M$ contains all sequences of elements of
$M$ of length $\theta$. $j$ is called a <em>high-jump embedding</em>, and a
<a href="Filter" title="Filter">normal fine
ultrafilter</a>
on some $\mathcal{P}_\kappa(\lambda)$ generating an <a href="Ultrapower" title="Ultrapower">ultrapower
embedding</a>
that is high-jump is a <em>high-jump ultrafilter</em> (or <em>high-jump measure</em>).</p>

<p>$\kappa$ is called <em>almost high-jump</em> if $M$ is closed under sequences
of length $&lt;\theta$ instead, i.e. $M^\lambda\subseteq M$ for all
$\lambda&lt;\theta$. $j$ is then an <em>almost high-jump</em> embedding. This
means that for all $f:\kappa\to\kappa$, $M^{j(f)(\kappa)}\subseteq
M$.
<a href="Shelah" class="mw-redirect" title="Shelah">Shelah for supercompactness</a>
cardinals are a natural weakening of almost high-jump cardinals which
allows to have one embedding per $f:\kappa\to\kappa$ rather than a
single embedding for all such $f$s.</p>

<p>$\kappa$ is high-jump <em>order $\eta$</em> (resp. almost high-jump <em>order
$\eta$</em>) if there exists a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals
$\{\theta_\alpha:\alpha&lt;\eta\}$ such that for all
$\alpha&lt;\eta$, there exists a high-jump embedding (resp. almost
high-jump embedding) with critical point $\kappa$ and clearance
$\theta_\alpha$. $\kappa$ is <em>super high-jump</em> (resp. <em>super almost
high-jump</em>) if there are high-jump embeddings (resp. almost high-jump
embeddings) with arbtirarily large clearance (i.e. it is “(almost)
high-jump order Ord”).</p>

<p>A high-jump cardinal $\kappa$ has <em>unbounded excess closure</em> if for
some clearance $\theta$, for all cardinals $\lambda\geq\theta$,
there is a high-jump measure on $\mathcal{P}_\kappa(\lambda)$
generating an ultrapower embedding with clearance $\theta$.</p>

<p>The dual notion <em>high-jump-for-strongness</em>, where the closure condition
$M^\theta\subseteq M$ is weakened to $V_\theta\subseteq M$, turns
out to be equivalent to
<a href="Superstrong" title="Superstrong">superstrongness</a>.</p>

<h2 id="properties">
<a class="anchor" href="#properties" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Properties</h2>

<p>Let $j:V\to M$ a nontrivial elementary embedding with critical point
$\kappa$ and clearance $\theta$. Then there is no
$f:\kappa\to\kappa$ such that $j(f)(\kappa)=\theta$. Also,
$\kappa^{+}\leq cf(\theta)\leq 2^\kappa$ (see
<a href="Cofinality" class="mw-redirect" title="Cofinality">cofinality</a>)
and $\beth^M_\theta=\theta$. Moreover, $M_\theta\prec
M_{j(\kappa)}$ and $M_\theta$ satisfies ZFC where $M_\theta=M\cap
V_\theta$.</p>

<p>When $\kappa$ is almost high-jump, in both $V$ and $M$,
$\theta^\kappa=\theta$, also $\theta$ is
<a href="Singular" class="mw-redirect" title="Singular">singular</a>.
Moreover, $V_\theta\prec M_{j(\kappa)}$ and $V_\theta$ satisfies
ZFC.</p>

<p>The following statements also holds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose there is a almost high-jump cardinal. Then there are many
cardinals below it that are Shelah for supercompactness. Also, in
the model $V_\kappa$ there are many supercompact cardinals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Every high-jump cardinal is almost high-jump, and has order
$\theta$; in fact, in the models $V_\theta$, $V_\kappa$ and
$M_{j(\kappa)}$ there are many super almost high-jump cardinals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existence of a high-jump cardinal with order $\eta$ implies
that for every $\gamma&lt;\eta$, there exists a model in which
that cardinal is high-jump with order $\gamma$. The same statement
holds for almost high-jump cardinals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The existence of a high-jump cardinal with unbounded excess closure
is equiconsistent with the existence of a cardinal $\kappa$ such
that for all sufficiently large $\lambda$, there exists a high-jump
measure on $\mathcal{P}_\kappa(\lambda$).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose $\kappa$ is <a href="Huge" title="Huge">almost
huge</a>;
then in the model $V_\kappa$ there are many cardinals that are
high-jump with unbounded excess closure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Suppose that there exists a pair of cardinals ($\kappa$, $\theta$)
such that there is a high-jump embedding $j:V\to M$ with critical
point $\kappa$ and clearance $\theta$ and such that
$M^{2^\theta}\subseteq M$. Then the cardinal $\kappa$ is super
high-jump in the model $V_\theta$, and the cardinal $\kappa$ has
high-jump order $\theta$ in $V$. Furthermore, there are many super
high-jump cardinals in the models $V_\kappa$, $V_\theta$, and
$M_{j(\kappa)}$.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The least high-jump cardinal is not $\Sigma_2$-reflecting. In
particular, it is not supercompact and not even strong. The same is
true for the least <a href="Huge" title="Huge">almost
huge</a>
cardinal, the least
<a href="Superstrong" title="Superstrong">superstrong</a>
cardinal, the least almost-high-jump cardinal, and the least
Shelah-for-supercompactness cardinal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
