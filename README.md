# Cantor's Attic

Climb into Cantor's Attic, where you will find infinities large and
small. We aim to provide a comprehensive resource of information about
all notions of mathematical infinity. Our site is organized into several
large categories:

[The upper attic](Upper_attic "Upper attic")   
The upper attic is the realm of large cardinals and the higher infinite,
extending from inaccessibility to inconsistency.

[The middle attic](Middle_attic "Middle attic")   
The middle attic surveys the infinite cardinals whose existence can be
proved in, or is at least equiconsistent with, the ZFC axioms of set
theory.

[The lower attic](Lower_attic "Lower attic")   
The lower attic classifies various large countable ordinals.

[The parlour](Parlour "Parlour")   
Aspiring to the attic, the parlour contains the truly vast finite
numbers.

[The playroom](Playroom "Playroom")   
Enjoy the stimulating entertainments of the playroom, full of fun and
paradox.

[The library](Library "Library")   
Peruse the selections of our library, the central repository of all
references cited here at Cantor's attic.

[The cellar](Cellar "Cellar")   
Review the foundations of our subject with informative background
presentations of ideas used throughout the attic.

## How to help

Don't see your favorite large cardinal or ordinal? You can help! We've
only just begun to build our site, and we welcome knowledgeable expert
contributions from the mathematical logic community. Please see the
