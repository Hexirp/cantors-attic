</ul><p>Given two transitive structures $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, an
<strong>elementary embedding</strong> from $\mathcal{M}$ to $\mathcal{N}$ is a
function $j:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{N}$ such that $j(\mathcal{M})$ is
an <em>elementary substructure</em> of $\mathcal{N}$, i.e. satisfies the same
first-order sentences as $\mathcal{N}$ does. Obviously, if
$\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{N}$, then $j(x)=x$ is an elementary embedding
from $\mathcal{M}$ to itself, but is then called a <strong>trivial</strong>
embedding. An embedding is <strong>nontrivial</strong> if there exists
$x\in\mathcal{M}$ such that $j(x)\neq x$.</p>

<p>The critical point is the smallest ordinal moved by $j$. By $j$’s
elementarity, $j(\kappa)$ must also be an ordinal, and therefore it is
comparable with $\kappa$. It is easy to see why
$j(\kappa)\leq\kappa$ is impossible, thus $j(\kappa)&gt;\kappa$.</p>

<h2 id="definition">
<a class="anchor" href="#definition" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Definition</h2>

<p>Given two transitive classes $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$, and a
function $j:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}$, $j$ is an elementary
embedding if and only if for every first-order formula $\varphi$ with
parameters $x_1,…,x_n\in\mathcal{N}$, one has:
\(\\mathcal{M}\\models\\varphi(x\_1,...,x\_2)\\iff\\mathcal{N}\\models\\varphi(j(x\_1),...,j(x\_2))\)</p>

<p>$j$ is nontrivial if and only if it has a critical point, i.e.
$\exists\kappa(j(\kappa)\neq\kappa)$. Indeed, one can show by
transfinite induction that if $j$ does not move any ordinal then $j$
does not move any set at all, thus a critical point must exists whenever
$j$ is nontrivial.</p>

<h2 id="tarski-vaught-test">
<a class="anchor" href="#tarski-vaught-test" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tarski-Vaught Test</h2>

<p>If $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ are both $\tau$-structures for
some language $\tau$, and $j:\mathcal{M}\rightarrow\mathcal{N}$,
then $j$ is an elementary embedding iff:</p>

<ol>
  <li>$j$ is injective (for any $x$ in $N$, there is <em>at most</em> one $y$ in
$M$ such that $j(y)=x$).</li>
  <li>$j$ has the following properties:
    <ol>
      <li>For any constant symbol $c\in\tau$,
$j(c^\mathcal{M})=c^\mathcal{N}$.</li>
      <li>For any function symbol $f\in\tau$ and $a_0,a_1…\in M$,
$j(f^\mathcal{M}(a_0,a_1…))=f^\mathcal{N}(j(a_0),j(a_1)…)$.
For example,
$j(a_0+^\mathcal{M}a_1)=j(a_0)+^\mathcal{N}j(a_1)$.</li>
      <li>For any relation symbol $r\in\tau$ and $a_0,a_1…\in M$,
$r^\mathcal{M}(a_0,a_1…)\Leftrightarrow
r^\mathcal{N}(j(a_0),j(a_1)…)$</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>For any first-order formula $\psi$ and any $x_0,x_1…\in M$
such that there is $y\in N$ with
$\psi^\mathcal{N}(y,j(x_0),j(x_1)…)$, there is $z\in M$ with
$\psi^\mathcal{M}(z,x_0,x_1…)$.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <strong>Tarski-Vaught test</strong> refers to the special case where
$\mathcal{M}$ is a substructure of $\mathcal{N}$ and $j(x)=x$ for
every $x$.</p>

<p>This test determines if $\mathcal{M}$ is an elementary substructure of
$\mathcal{N}$. More specifically, $\mathcal{M}$ is an elementary
substructure of $\mathcal{N}$ iff for any $\psi$ and $x_0,x_1…\in
M$ such that there is $y\in N$ with
$\psi^\mathcal{N}(y,x_0,x_1…)$, there is $z\in M$ with
$\psi^\mathcal{M}(z,x_0,x_1…)$.</p>

<h2 id="use-in-large-cardinal-axioms">
<a class="anchor" href="#use-in-large-cardinal-axioms" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Use in Large Cardinal Axioms</h2>

<p>There are two ways of making the critical point as large as possible:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Making $\mathcal{M}$ as large as possible, much larger than
$\mathcal{N}$ (meaning that a “large” class can be embedded into a
smaller class)</li>
  <li>Making $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ more similar (for example,
$\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{N}$ yet $j$ is nontrivial)</li>
</ol>

<p>Using the first method, one can simply take $\mathcal{M}=V$ (the
universe of all sets), and the resulting critical point is always a
measurable cardinal, a very strong type of large cardinal, e.g. the
first measurable is larger than infinitely many weakly compact cardinals
(and much more).</p>

<p>Using the second method, one can take, say, $\mathcal{M} = \mathcal{N}
= L$, i.e. create an embedding $j:L\to L$, whose existence has very
important consequences, such as the existence of
<a href="Zero_sharp" class="mw-redirect" title="Zero sharp">$0^#$</a>
(and thus $V\neq L$) and implies that every ordinal that is an
uncountable cardinal in V is strongly inaccessible in L. By taking
$\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{N}=V_\lambda$, i.e. a rank of the cumulative
hiearchy, one obtains the very powerful
<a href="Rank-into-rank" class="mw-redirect" title="Rank-into-rank">rank-into-rank</a>
axioms, which sit near the very top of the large cardinal hiearchy.
However, this second method has its limits, as shown by Kunen, as he
showed that $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{N}=V$ leads to an inconsistency with
the
<a href="Axiom_of_choice" class="mw-redirect" title="Axiom of choice">axiom of choice</a>,
a theorem now known as the <strong><a href="Kunen_inconsistency" title="Kunen inconsistency">Kunen
inconsistency</a></strong>.
He also showed that a natural strengthening of the rank-into-rank
axioms, $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{N}=V_{\lambda+2}$ for some
$\lambda\in Ord$, was inconsistent with the $AC$.</p>

<p>Most large cardinal axioms inbetween measurables and rank-into-rank
axioms are obtained by mixing those two methods: one usually sets
$\mathcal{M}=V$ then requires $\mathcal{N}$ to satisfies strong
closure properties to make it “larger”, i.e. closer to $V$ (that is, to
$\mathcal{M}$). For example, $j:V\to\mathcal{N}$ is nontrivial with
critical point $\kappa$ and the cumulative hiearchy rank
$V_{j(\kappa)}$ is a subset of $\mathcal{N}$ then $\kappa$ is
<a href="Superstrong" title="Superstrong">superstrong</a>;
if $\mathcal{N}$ contains all sequences of elements of $\mathcal{N}$
of length $\lambda$ for some $\lambda&gt;\kappa$ then $\kappa$ is
$\lambda$-<a href="Supercompact" title="Supercompact">supercompact</a>,
and so on.</p>

<p>The existence of a nontrivial elementary embedding
$j:\mathcal{M}\to\mathcal{N}$ <em>that is definable in $\mathcal{M}$</em>
implies that the critical point $\kappa$ of $j$ is
<a href="Measurable" title="Measurable">measurable</a>
in $\mathcal{M}$ (not necessarily in $V$). Every measurable ordinal is
<a href="Weakly_compact" title="Weakly compact">weakly
compact</a>
and (strongly)
<a href="Inaccessible" title="Inaccessible">inaccessible</a>
therefore its existence in any model is beyond $ZFC$, meaning that $ZFC$
cannot prove that such an embedding exists.</p>

<h2 id="absoluteness">
<a class="anchor" href="#absoluteness" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Absoluteness</h2>

<p>The following results can be used in theorems about
<a href="Remarkable" title="Remarkable">remarkable</a>
cardinals and other virtual variants.</p>

<p>(section from
<a class="citation" href="#Bagaria2017">(Bagaria, 2017)</a> unless
otherwise noted)</p>

<p>The existence of an embedding of a countable model into another fixed
model is absolute:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a countable first-order structure $M$ and an elementary
embedding $j : M → N$, if $W ⊆ V$ is a transitive (set or class)
model of (some sufficiently large fragment of) ZFC such that $M$ is
countable in $W$ and $N ∈ W$, then $W$ has some elementary embedding
$j^∗ : M → N$.</li>
  <li>If additionally both $M$ and $N$ are transitive $∈$-structures, we
can assume that $crit(j^∗) = crit(j)$.</li>
  <li>We can also require that $j$ and $j^∗$ agree on some fixed finite
number of values.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore an elementary embedding $j : B → A$ between first-order
structures exists in some set-forcing extension iff it already exists in
$V^{Coll(ω,B)}$. Specifically, the following are equivalent for
structures $B$ and $A$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is a complete Boolean algebra $\mathbb{B}$ such that
$V^\mathbb{B} \models$ “There is an elementary embedding $j : B →
A$.”</li>
  <li>In $V^{Coll(ω,B)}$ there is an elementary embedding $j : B → A$.</li>
  <li>For every complete Boolean algebra $\mathbb{B}$,
$V^\mathbb{B} \models$ “$|B| = \aleph_0 \implies$ There is an
elementary embedding $j : B → A$.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, if $B$ and $A$ are transitive $∈$-structures, we can assume
that the embeddings have the same critical point and agree on finitely
many fixed values.</p>

<p>These are also equivalent to player II having a winning strategy in game
$G(B, A)$ defined in the following subsection.</p>

<p>Next fact: For first-order structures $M$ and $N$ in a common language,
if there is an elementary embedding $j : M → N$ in some set-forcing
extension, then there is such an embedding $j^∗ : M → N$ in any forcing
extension in which $M$ has been made countable. Moreover, one can
arrange that $j^∗$ agrees with $j$ on any given finite set of values and
that, if appropriate, $crit(j) =
crit(j^*)$.<a class="citation" href="#Gitman2018">(Gitman &amp; Hamkins, 2018)</a></p>

<h3 id="in-the-language-of-game-theory">
<a class="anchor" href="#in-the-language-of-game-theory" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>In the language of game theory</h3>

<p>To every pair of structures B and A of the same type, one can associate
a closed game $G(B, A)$ (variant of an Ehrenfeucht-Fraı̈ssé game) such
that $B$ elementarily embeds into $A$ in $V^{Coll(ω,B)}$ precisely when
a particular player has a winning strategy in that game. Namely:</p>

<p>The game $G(B, A)$ is a game of length $ω$, where player I starts by
playing some $b_0 ∈ B$ and player II responds by playing $a_0 ∈ A$.
Players I and II continue to alternate, choosing elements $b_n$ and
$a_n$ from their respective structures at stage $n$ of the game. II
wins if for every $(n+1)$-parameter formula $φ$</p>

<p>$B \models φ(b_0 , . . . , b_n ) \iff A \models φ(a_0 , . . . ,
a_n)$</p>

<p>and I wins otherwise.</p>

<p>Since if II loses he must do so at some finite stage of the game, the
game $G(B, A)$ is closed and hence determined by the Gale-Stewart
theorem (Gale and Stewart, 1953). Thus, either I or II has a winning
strategy.</p>

<p>Player II has a winning strategy precisely when $B$ elementarily embeds
into $A$ in $V^{Coll(ω,B)}$. It follows that each first-order fragment
of

is characterised by the existence of certain winning strategies in its
associated class of closed games.</p>
