</ul><p>We will denote an arbitrary ordering relation by $R$. We will establish
some preliminary definitions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An ordering $R$ is <em>reflexive</em> if and only if $xRx$, for all $x$ in
the domain of $R$.</li>
  <li>An ordering $R$ is <em>irreflexive</em> if and only if $\neg xRx$.</li>
  <li>An ordering $R$ is <em>transitive</em> if and only if $xRy$ and $yRz$
implies $xRz$, for all $x$, $y$, and $z$.</li>
  <li>An ordering $R$ is <em>antisymmetric</em> if and only if $xRy$ and $yRx$
implies $x=y$.</li>
  <li>An ordering $R$ is <em>trichotomous</em> if and only if $xRy$, $x=y$, or
$yRx$ for all $x$ and $y$ in the field of $R$.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="partial-ordering">
<a class="anchor" href="#partial-ordering" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Partial Ordering</h2>

<p>A <em>partial ordering</em> consists of a relation along with a set such as $(
A , \le )$ such that the order is reflexive, transitive, and
antisymmetric for all members of $A$.</p>

<p>A <em>strict partial ordering</em> consists of an ordered pair $( A , \lt )$
that is irreflexive and transitive for all members of $A$.</p>

<p>All strict partial orders are <em>asymmetric</em>, meaning that $xRy$ implies
that $\neg yRx$.</p>

<h2 id="total-ordering">
<a class="anchor" href="#total-ordering" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Total Ordering</h2>

<p>A <em>total ordering</em> consists of a partial ordering where any two elements
are comparable, that is, for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$, $x\le y \lor
y\le x$</p>

<p>A <em>strict total ordering</em> is a strict partial ordering that is also
trichotomous.</p>

<h2 id="well-founded-relations">
<a class="anchor" href="#well-founded-relations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Well-Founded Relations</h2>

<p>A <em>minimal element</em> of $B$ with respect to a strict ordering relation
$\lt$ is an element $x$ of $B$ that is not greater than any other
element in $B$. That is $\forall y \in B: \neg y \lt x$</p>

<p>A <em>well-founded relation</em> is an ordering $\lt$ under $A$ such that any
nonempty subset $x$ of $A$ contains a minimal element.</p>

<p>There are many interesting properties of well-founded relations. For
example, all well-founded relations do not have any ordering “loops”.
That is, they are irreflexive, asymmetric, etc.</p>

<p>Well-founded relations do not have any infinitely descending
$&lt;$-chains. Another way to state this is that no function $f$ mapping
the natural numbers to well-founded set $A$ where $f(n+1) &lt; f(n)$ for
all natural numbers $n$.</p>

<p>Any subset of $A$, even if it is a proper class, must have a minimal
element. The proof of this is not as straightforward as it sounds.</p>

<p>We can also prove schemas of well-founded induction and well-founded
recursion; the first strongly resembles epsilon induction, while the
second defines a function $F(x)$ in terms of a function $G$ of the
restriction of $F$ to the initial segment of $x$.</p>

<p>An <em>initial segment</em> or <em>extension</em> of $x$ is the collection of all sets
in $A$ less than $x$.</p>

<p>We call a well-founded relation <em>setlike</em> if the initial segments of all
the elements of $A$ are elements.</p>

<h2 id="well-ordering-relations">
<a class="anchor" href="#well-ordering-relations" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Well-Ordering Relations</h2>

<p>A <em>well-ordering</em> relation is a well-founded relation that is also a
strict total order. Equivalently, we can also define a well-ordering
relation as a well-founded relation that satisfies trichotomy.</p>

<p>The ordinals can be defined as the set of all transitive sets that are
well-ordered by the membership relation.</p>

<p>The <a href="Well-ordering_principle" title="Well-ordering principle">Well-ordering
principle</a>
shows that all sets have some well-order associated with them.</p>

<p>All well-ordered sets are
<a href="Order-isomorphism" title="Order-isomorphism">order-isomorphic</a>
to the ordinals.</p>
